We are looking for people who want to help us change the game, not just play it.What you will work on:You will work within an agile team to help define the story and test requirements, pair with other testers and developers to produce Acceptance and Integration Tests using our in-house DSL and use your testing and domain knowledge to combine automated, exploratory and technical testing; enabling the team to deliver completed stories with minimal technical debt.Stories can cover anything from core exchange functionality, through big data issues and performance to new portals to manage our business. The process from idea to implementation is fluid and will involve working with colleagues in different parts of the business to understand what they want and how they will use it, whiteboard sessions, digging into code, databases and existing Acceptance Tests to understand behaviour and coming up with new and interesting ways to test, and break, the system.We follow TDD and BDD methodologies to create automated regression tests and if you are going to test something more than once then automate it andndash; this can mean anything: migrations, databases, invariants, performance, tools, integrations, logging, releases; we have more than the average types of tests. You will have input to all this and hopefully help us to discover more test types along the way. All this automation allows you the time to carry out exploratory testing and try out new ideas to improve the way we develop software. We work together at a sustainable pace and spend the time on those areas that need it, leaving everything in a better state than we found it.\nTesting does not stop at release time; with extensive monitoring and andldquo;testing in liveandrdquo; you can analyse data from new features for unexpected behaviour or performance and with regular stints as part of the production support pair you will get to assist and understand our business from the front and gain a different perspective.What you will work onThe LMAX test team works across the whole of the business. To avoid accumulating knowledge silos, we actively rotate testers around our teams, ensuring that everyone gains first-hand knowledge on all areas of our testing and codebase and gets to work on a wide variety of projects, such as:\nandbull; Testing low-latency trading systems\nandbull; Testing cyptocurrency integrations\nandbull; Testing the platformandrsquo;s security and resilienceOur tech stack\nandbull; Backend: distributed, event-driven core Java (90% of the code base), MySQL\nandbull; Frontend: Javascript, Vue.js\nandbull; OS: Linux (CentOS)\nandbull; Testing is mostly via in house tools, written in Java using JUnit, Selenium, JenkinsWhat we are looking forWith excellent communication skills you have an enthusiastic approach to testing and a passion to continually improve the testing processes. In your previous roles you will have questioned the norms of testing methods and processes and pushed back when it was needed.Experience of testing web and back-end platforms with strong technical and exploratory testing skills would be useful but we can teach that, however, you must bring problem-solving skills, enthusiasm, the ability to understand complex abstract concepts and be happy learning our set of technologies.Above all, we are looking for someone who shares our values and is great to work with.Our ValuesWorking collaboratively: We work in a very social and collaborative environment, even while remote. Working as a team and with colleagues from across the business, allows multiple ideas to combine into stronger designs and better solutions. Pair programming ensures high quality code, supports knowledge growth and sharing of expertise. With many eyes contributing to any code before it goes into production, you will rarely find a traditional code review at LMAX.Test driven: LMAX relies heavily on test driven development and automation. We gain rapid feedback and confidence from 35,000 end-to-end tests running every half an hour. There are also extensive unit, compatibility, migration, and resilience tests.We care a lot more about software performance than many other organisations. We have a range of continuous performance tests designed to catch any regression before it reaches production, from targeted micro-benchmarks to end-to-end replays of production traffic.Dedicated to quality: We care a lot about quality; we like to dig deep into the code-base and leave things better than we found them - more readable, better modelled, more performant, more consistent. There is a permanent expectation of delivering high quality, maintainable code, and minimising technical debt.You wonandrsquo;t be stressed about deadlines and pressured to cut corners just to get things done quickly. As a team we enjoy building software and seeing that software used, and although we want to deliver things in a timely manner, we always strive to write things properly and cleanly the first time.Always improving: We regularly examine our successes and failures to look at how we can improve both as a team and individually.

Our mission is to provide an industry-leading platform that enables enterprises to run their training function more efficiently and effectively so that they can focus more on connecting with people than administrating programs.</p><br /><p>Our platform has evolved a lot in recent years, taking us up market, squarely into the enterprise tech space. We&rsquo;re delighted with the success we&rsquo;ve experienced so far, and we enjoy working together. Our headquarters are in Edinburgh, Scotland's capital city.

You were constantly striving to do it better and faster.</p><br /><p>You creatively code and work on your own great stuff for fun, but at work you choose standards and reuse, because teams are not just one person, and you don't reinvent the wheel.</p><br /><p>You're striving for perfection, but grounded in reality, getting the job done comes first, but it's never something to hide behind, because you don't do 'ok'. If something isn't working you say why, and how to sort it.</p><br /><p>You're honest to a fault.</p><br /><p>You love to work with great people and understand that small teams, dynamic companies and flexible working environments are unparalleled.</p><br /><p>You are keen to develop and grow your career and skills with a passion for learning and continuous improvement.

Our product is born out of scientific research, data-driven methodologies and has a purpose: it removes flawed signifiers, mitigates systemic inequalities, and surfaces the best candidates, taking the guesswork out of hiring.Given what we do, weandrsquo;re keen to build diverse teams and offer flexible and part-time working hours. We trust people to work enough hours to do good work, at times that suit you and your team.You can read more about us in the New York Times, Harvard Business Review, TechCrunch and New Scientist and learn more about how we give Candidates useful feedback here. About Our Engineering Team A note about our team: we place high value on trust, communication, ambition, empathy, accountability, user and data driven decisions, and have a bias towards action and curiosity.Weandrsquo;re a team who:Are passionate about making high quality digital products that add real and meaningful value to people's lives\nCan collaborate effectively, inspire those around them, and start from a position of empathy.\nUnderstand the business objectives, the needs of the broader team and work with product managers to prioritise accordingly.\nAre comfortable working in an early-stage environment, and the uncertainty (fun!) that change can bring. Get the right balance between beautiful code, and getting things done.\nThe RoleWeandrsquo;re changing the way hiring is done for good and need to scale our engineering team to build great features for users on an infrastructure that's fit to scale with us. We want to build a platform that's as much of a pleasure to work on as a developer as it is to use as a customer!We have a great starting point: 100s of customers that love us, a mature and easy deployment process, good test setups, nice infrastructure (Lambda, Fargate, ECS, Terraform, Elasticsearch...) and a nice tech stack (Node.js, Vue). We have big plans to ensure scalability and developer experience - decoupling as much as we can, moving to Typescript to help us write safe code easily and using functional approaches to ramp up modularity and maintainability.In your first 6 months at Applied you'll:Make big contributions to our product. You'll be deploying to production on day one and getting stuck into our scrum process from the very start.\nBe involved in product design - as engineers we care about our users and work closely throughout the product design process to ensure we deliver great features quickly.\nGet to know (and work on) the entire product + infrastructure.\nWork to improve our infrastructure, tooling and tech stack.\nShape our process - we love a good retro and continually inspecting and improving how we work is core to how we work as a team.\nYou'll benefit from:Equity in the business\nWellbeing benefit and access to Spill\nRemote working budget\nInternet stipend\nLearning and development budget + progression support\nInvolved in other aspects of the business, from strategy, management and training, to shaping team culture\nBeing part of something that's both commercially successful and socially important\nWeandrsquo;re working remotely first and finding better options for folks who need an office. Our general aim is to have 2 away days throughout the year so we can all meet in person at least a few times a year.Next StepsOur process is progressive - Instead of submitting a CV, youandrsquo;ll answer 5 work-related questions. Our goal is to assess your approach to a problem, and better understand what knowledge and skills you have.If you work at Applied, you'll need to search for things, so feel free to do this during the application as it isnandrsquo;t a test.Your answers will be anonymized, randomized and reviewed by the team. We use these scores to shortlist for interview where we will do a tech design session as a team, a pair programming task and a reverse interview where you get to ask us questions.We also think giving feedback is incredibly valuable for candidates, so at the end of the process you'll see how well you performed during the application process.Right to work: We are open to engineers who live within a 4 hour timezone of London, UK.

To help achieve this mission The Imaging Program aims to give researchers everywhere the tools to visualize and quantify the biological processes underlying health and disease. We're supporting scientists worldwide who operate imaging facilities, which serve as hubs of imaging expertise for local communities of biomedical researchers, and we're creating community and building capacity through organizations like Global BioImaging and BioImaging North America. We fund and build image analysis tools like napari, an interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python, and fund Imaging Software Fellows. We're also pushing the frontiers of imaging by supporting technology development, including ultrasound, MRI, photoacoustic, optical, X-ray, and quantum imaging, that will allow researchers to better understand and cure disease.

          "description": "At Canva, our mission is to democratize design and empower creativity and visual expression for every person, on every platform. Since launch in April 2013, our user base has grown exponentially, amassing over 15 million monthly active users in over 190 different countries, making us one of the world's fastest-growing technology companies. As of today, we've achieved profitability, and the company is valued over USD$3.2 Billion, which comfortably prepares us for the next phase of growth and development.Software engineering is the core of who we are at Canva. The Canva code base was built to scale from day one. This has allowed for a unique environment where engineers spend most of their time optimizing performance and releasing new features rather than fixing legacy code. With an adherence to fundamentals and first principles, the team strives to use the most appropriate tools for the tasks at hand, aiming to strike that carefully measured balance between getting things done and long-term maintainability of the code base and supporting infrastructure.We promote a warm and collaborative work environment where engineers set big goals and are given the tools and support to achieve them. We also invite our engineers to contribute to the direction their peers are taking with proactive pair ups for peer-reviewing of code as well as regular engineering forums for opinions and ideas to be heard. These practices ensure that knowledge is shared and releases are quick and efficient. Finally - you're probably curious about our technology stack.

Since launch in April 2013, our user base has grown exponentially, amassing over 15 million monthly active users in over 190 different countries, making us one of the world's fastest-growing technology companies.  As of today, we've achieved profitability, and the company is valued over USD$3.2 Billion, which comfortably prepares us for the next phase of growth and development.</span></p><br /><p>Software engineering is the core of who we are at Canva.  The Canva code base was built to scale from day one. This has allowed for a unique environment where engineers spend most of their time optimizing performance and releasing new features rather than fixing legacy code.  With an adherence to fundamentals and first principles, the team strives to use the most appropriate tools for the tasks at hand, aiming to strike that carefully measured balance between getting things done and long-term maintainability of the code base and supporting infrastructure.</p><br /><p><span>We promote a warm and collaborative work environment where engineers set big goals and are given the tools and support to achieve them.  We also invite our engineers to contribute to the direction their peers are taking with proactive pair ups for peer-reviewing of code as well as regular engineering forums for opinions and ideas to be heard.  These practices ensure that knowledge is shared and releases are quick and efficient. </span></p><br /><p><span>Finally - you're probably curious about our technology stack.

Our teams use modern, agile methods to design and engineer government systems that connect Veterans with services, bring affordable health care to millions of people, and support important programs like Head Start. And as we work to make critical government services intuitive, accessible, and human-centered, we're also changing how the government thinks about and uses technology. If you thrive on change, want to help close the gap between consumer expectations and government services, and can see the possibilities in ambiguity, then we want you here with us. What matters most\nAd Hoc operates according to our commitment to inclusivity, acceptance, accountability, and humility. We aren't heroes.

We achieve this by linking learning to kidsandrsquo; interests, connecting them with other classmates who share their passions, and giving them the autonomy to pick their own paths. Our small group classes meet over live video chat with teachers who celebrate their unique strengths and empower all learners to develop confidence and a strong sense of self.We're also focused on removing barriers for historically underserved learners who face systemic challenges to their success. In 2020, we started Outschool.org and began offering financial assistance to families in need. We are currently creating an Educator Endowment Fund to appreciate the teachers who are so central to our mission of inspiring kids to love learning.We believe that diversity drives learning.

          "description_html": "<p><strong><b>Senior Front-end Software Engineer</b></strong></p><p>Looking for a company where you can shape how the world buys, sells, and gives? Where you&#39;ll be supported in challenging convention, taking risks, and innovating? Where you&#39;ll form part of a work culture that&#39;s been genuinely committed to diversity and inclusion since its founding more than 25 years ago? Where you can just be yourself, do your best work, and have a meaningful impact? If so, we&#39;d love to talk to you.</p><p>Every day, millions of users sell and ship their wares using eBay. Our team supports this varied community by building shipping products around the globe, helping individual sellers and small businesses to meet the growing expectations of online buyers. We are a product-first team who move fast and stay curious. Join us to make an impact on one of the world&#39;s largest e-commerce websites.</p><p><b>WHAT YOU BRING:</b></p><p>- Agile: Test-Driven Development, collaboration and continuous delivery are your preferred engineering practices. We take the best bits of Lean, Scrum and Kanban too.</p><p>- Architecture: In a large scale distributed web-application, you choose the right tool for the job at hand. You know when to break something out into a new component and the best way to wire it in, when to go with the simplest fit into the current system and when to rethink the existing approach.</p><p>- Experience: You have 4&#43; years of experience working at a high level, confident working on a range of languages and frameworks and are happy to pick up new ones. You like working on established technology stacks as well as continuously changing platforms.</p><p><b>WHAT WE BRING:</b></p><p>- Rewarding technical challenges - fixing eCommerce delivery requires solving difficult technical problems: building unified shipping platforms for diverse customers, iterating fast while providing the best customer experience, constantly improving our technology while dealing with the eBay volume is what we do best.</p><p>- Wonderful, bright, air-conditioned offices in Shoreditch, with bike racks (and shower!), right next to Liverpool St and Shoreditch High Street stations for super easy commuting, and lots of great food options nearby.</p><p>- Great company culture - we have a culture of respect and high expectations of others. We love sharing a drink during our Friday All Hands, play board games and enjoy free lunch on our demo day.</p><p>- Flexible working - really great support for working from home (we&#39;ve got good video conferencing facilities) and a great holiday package.</p><p>- Competitive salary and generous benefits.</p><p><b>WHAT YOU&#39;LL DO/LEARN:</b></p><p>- You will be a member of one of eBay&#39;s Shipping agile teams. You will work across the full development cycle, from helping to define the roadmap to deploying and monitoring your work in production.</p><p>- You&#39;ll mainly be working with React on our front-end clients, including TypeScript, Webpack, CSS Modules, Less, and Sass. A willingness to do occasional work on our back-end systems (written in Node.js, Java, and Kotlin) is a bonus.</p><p>- Apply TDD/BDD and other agile practices on all the code you deliver.</p><p>- Constantly improve quality: refactoring code, proposing new tools and changing processes.</p><p>- Pair with team members and collaborate with remote teams to share knowledge and give/get constant feedback.</p><p>- Previous experience on mature agile teams delivering continuously is preferred.</p><p>Benefits are an essential part of your total compensation for the work you do every day. Whether youre single, in a growing family, or nearing retirement, eBay offers a variety of comprehensive and competitive benefit programs to meet your needs. Including maternal &amp; paternal leave, paid sabbatical, and plans to help ensure your financial security today and in the years ahead because we know feeling financially secure during your working years and through retirement is important.</p><p>Here at eBay, we love creating opportunities for others by connecting people from widely diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and geographies. So, being diverse and inclusive isnt just something we strive for, it is who we are, and part of what we do each and every single day.

PRODUCT: iOS and Android native mobile apps that give small/indie business people a second phone number just for work.

Check out usechalkboard.com to learn more about us.andzwj; THE JOB: Mobile developer working on our native iOS and Android apps, all experience levels welcome from mid-level right through to lead/senior.

If youandrsquo;d like to work from a local co-working space, we offer a andpound;250 ($350) a month allowance. LOCATION: Beehive Lofts is our lovely HQ workplace in Ancoats, Manchester, UK. Great coffee, lovely teas, dog-friendly, more sofas than DFS, plants (and then some). Fun fact: it used to be home to legendary Manchester nightclub Sankeyandrsquo;s.

FOUNDER: Weandrsquo;re headed up by John Jackson, who has already built and sold 2 tech businesses. We are funded directly by Johnandrsquo;s investments so weandrsquo;re in full financial control.

We think the best features are a result of tight collaboration between product and engineering. We use the best tools for the job, but they need to be proven. DEV PROCESS: Each feature moves through product design, architecture, development, testing, and release, in a Kanban-style workflow that we manage in a tool called Shortcut.

MUST HAVES: We are looking for mid-level upwards. So you should have 3+ years commercial experience, and have experience working with Swift and/or Kotlin, MVVM/MVVM-C, dependency injection, and writing tests. HOW WE HIRE: With respect for your time, and transparency.

Here&rsquo;s all you need to know:</p><br /><p> <strong>STACK:</strong> Swift and Kotlin for our mobile apps. GraphQL between our apps and the backend. Backend is Node.js, TypeScript, and PostgresQL. We host with Heroku.</p><br /><p> <strong>APIs YOU&rsquo;LL SWEAR AT:</strong> Facebook and Google (for our reviews feature), Twilio (for telephony), Postmark (for sending emails that don&rsquo;t end up in SPAM).</p><br /><p> <strong>PRODUCT:</strong> iOS and Android native mobile apps that give small/indie business people a second phone number just for work. It makes it easy for them to separate their personal lives from business with features like auto reply to missed calls, and extra tools to help them grow. Check out <a href=\"http://www.usechalkboard.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">usechalkboard.com</a> to learn more about us.</p><br /><p>&zwj; <strong>THE JOB:</strong> Backend developer building out our GraphQL API, all experience levels welcome from mid-level right through to lead/senior.</p><br /><p> <strong>REMOTE?:</strong> Yes, fully remote working (UK &amp; Europe currently). If you&rsquo;d like to work from a local co-working space, we offer a &pound;250 ($350) a month allowance.</p><br /><p> <strong>LOCATION:</strong> <a href=\"https://beehivelofts.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Beehive Lofts</a> is our lovely HQ workplace in Ancoats, Manchester, UK. Great coffee, lovely teas, dog-friendly, more sofas than DFS, plants (and then some). Fun fact: it used to be home to legendary Manchester nightclub Sankey&rsquo;s.</p><br /><p> <strong>FOR YOU:</strong> Great salary (&pound;35-&pound;55k / $50-$75k depending on your experience level), 25 days off + public holidays, flexible hours, MacBook Pro or BYOD allowance, plus &pound;400 ($550) to spend as you wish on your home workstation.</p><br /><p> <strong>TEAM:</strong> Small but mighty experienced, there&rsquo;s 10 of us (and growing fast!). We&rsquo;ve got an engineering manager, product manager, product designer, and of course our seven other Swift, Kotlin, and JavaScript developers.</p><br /><p> <strong>FUTURE GOALS:</strong> We see a future where thousands of businesses around the world are using Chalkboard to communicate with customers and teammates - on the move, in retail locations, out in the real world.</p><br /><p> <strong>FOUNDER:</strong> We&rsquo;re headed up by John Jackson, who has already built and sold 2 tech businesses. We are funded directly by John&rsquo;s investments so we&rsquo;re in full financial control.</p><br /><p> <strong>TECH PRINCIPLES:</strong> We have a mature test suite and endeavour to maintain it as part of our development process. All code changes are peer reviewed. We think the best features are a result of tight collaboration between product and engineering. We use the best tools for the job, but they need to be proven.</p><br /><p> <strong>DEV PROCESS:</strong> Each feature moves through product design, architecture, development, testing, and release, in a Kanban-style workflow that we manage in a tool called Shortcut (formerly known as Clubhouse).</p><br /><p> <strong>PRODUCT PRINCIPLES:</strong> We believe in a strong focus on user experience, convention over configuration, accessibility, low touch high volume, no stiff business jargon, and always championing local business.</p><br /><p> <strong>MUST HAVES:</strong> We are looking for mid-level upwards. So you should have 3+ years commercial experience, and have experience working with Node, TypeScript, relational databases, developing APIs, and writing tests.</p><br /><p> <strong>HOW WE HIRE:</strong> With respect for your time, and transparency. First some simple technical questions, then an intro call to make sure we&rsquo;re all on the same page. Next a short own-time challenge that takes no more than a few hours, and finally an interview (sometimes 2).</p><br /><p> <strong>TO SUM UP:</strong> Join a financially secure start up with a grand plan, an experienced team building quality products using sound technical principles, and a well-written codebase. Help millions of small and local businesses to operate, grow, and thrive.</p><br /><p>If this sounds like the perfect opportunity for you, we can't wait to hear from you!</p>",
